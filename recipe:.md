recipe:
1. Add half cup urad dal, 3 tablespoons chana dal and half teaspoon methi seeds to a large pot or bowl. Also measure 3 tablespoons poha and set aside. Wash and soak it just 30 mins before blending the batter.

2. Also measure 1½ cups raw rice & ½ cups idli rice. You can also use only raw rice. Add them to another large bowl.

3. Wash and soak them separately for 4 to 5 hours.

4. Drain water from dal. Add dal and poha to a blender jar with 1¼ cup water and salt as needed. You can skip salt if you live in a hot place. Without adding salt, my batter doesn’t ferment. So I use while blending.

5. Blend them to a batter that is frothy and bubbly. The batter must not be very thick or very runny at this stage.
